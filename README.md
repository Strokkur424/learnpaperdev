## Motivation
Having written for the official [PaperMC docs](https://github.com/PaperMC/docs), I noticed that what annoyed me the most is the long times and fairly limited scope. I couldn't just
write whatever I wanted and however I wanted. You have to keep stuff unopinionated and also fairly concise. And due to proof-reading of multiple other docs maintainers, the time
it takes for a PR to be merged, takes fairly long. But that all isn't that big a problem â€” the PaperMC docs are supposed to be a documentation after all.

A thing I noticed though is that you cannot really learn anything if you have never dabbled in plugin development before, as it can quickly become overwhelming. And many other resources
are either very outdated or paid. And we cannot have that in our modern, free world! So for this exact reason, I decided to create this project! Here, you can find all kinds of guides for
various plugins to get you started on your Minecraft plugin developer journey!

## Current Status
There is a few guides planned, but at the moment I will be focusing on extending the beginner's guide. That is the main selling point of this project after all. During this guide I
will make sure to include modern concepts and APIs in order to supersede all other guides.

## Do you accept PRs?
The short answer is: no.
The longer answer is: Still no. I want to be able to write stuff my own way and I prefer to not have anybody mess with that. This may sound harsh at first, but reviewing PRs and trying to get
a potential contributor to do stuff exactly how you want them to is hard and takes a lot of time. So it is best for me personally to just write it myself. Primarily also as I then can build everything
exactly the way I had been envisioning it! Thank you for your understanding.

What I **do** accept though are issues. If you find that my writing has an issue, or you want to suggest a new guide idea, make sure to open an issue for it! Those help a lot and I am very grateful
for every issue I get, since that shows involvement in my work.

## How to contact me
Whilst I do plan to create a Discord server in the future, you can currently only contact me directly via DMs on Discord: [@strokkur24](https://discord.com/users/813141164281692170).
