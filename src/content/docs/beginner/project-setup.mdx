In order to start writing plugins, we first have to setup our project and our IDE. For this, [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
is the most widely used one. IntelliJ IDEA provides all tools and plugins necessary for efficient Java development and also provides native support for build tooling, like
[Gradle](https://gradle.org), which will be our choice of build tooling, as it is the suggested one by the PaperMC team.

## Installation

It is not necessary to install Gradle with IntelliJ together, as IntelliJ includes Gradle. But if you prefer to setup projects using a **CLI**, you may also
install Gradle with it.

        I personally recommend installing IntelliJ via the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), as it allows quick and easy
        updates of IntelliJ.

        Once you have installed the JetBrains Toolbox App, you will want to install **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**.

        After you have installed IntelliJ, you will want to open it and then open the settings by pressing `ctrl + alt + S`. You then want to navigate to `Plugins` and
        install the `Minecraft Development` plugin. It is a very widely used plugin for plugin and mod devs.

    <TabItem label="Gradle CLI">
        *Main article: https://gradle.org/install/*

        <Tabs syncKey="os">
            <TabItem label="Windows">
                On Windows, you first want to download the latest Gradle distribution. It is enough for you to just download the [binaries](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=8.13&format=bin).
                Once you have done that, you will want to unpack the zip into a new folder: `C:\Program Files\Gradle`. The file tree should look like this:

                <FileTree>
                    - `C:\Program Files\Gradle`
                        - gradle-8.13
                            - bin/
                            - init.d/
                            - lib/
                            - LICENSE
                            - NOTICE
                            - README
                </FileTree>

                After this, you want to add a new `PATH` environment variable entry. For this you can just search for `environment variables` in the start menu and open the first entry.

                <details>
                    <summary>Environment variables in the start menu</summary>
                    <img src={EnvironmentVariables.src}/>
                </details>


                You will then want to add an entry into your `Path`, pointing to `C:\Program Files\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin`:

                <Steps>

                1. Click on `Environment Variables...` in the bottom right.

                2. In the user variables, select the `Path` variable.

                3. Click `Edit...`

                4. Click `New` to add a new entry

                5. Paste `C:\Program Files\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin` and click `OK`

                </Steps>

                    <img src={EnvironmentVariablesEdit.src}/>
                </details>


                If you have done these steps correctly, you might have to close all open terminal processes for it to take effect.
                Now, you can run `gradle -v` in a new terminal session to verify your installed Gradle version.

                ```shell
                C:\>gradle -v

                ------------------------------------------------------------
                Gradle 8.13
                ------------------------------------------------------------
                ```

            </TabItem>

            <TabItem label="Linux">
                The recommended way to install Gradle on Linux is using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io), which also allows for managing multiple JDK installations:
                ```bash showlinenumbers=false
                $ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
                ```

                After you have installed SDKMAN!, you can now install Gradle.
                ```bash showlinenumbers=false
                $ sdk install gradle 1.13
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

## Creating a new project

<Tabs syncKey="setupWay">
    <TabItem label="IntelliJ">
        When creating a new project with IntelliJ, you will want to select `Java`. After that, you can fill out most fields however you want. Here is a quick breakdown of
        what each field does:

        | Field Name                | Usage                                                                                                                            |
        |---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | Name                      | This is the name of your project/plugin.                                                                                         |
        | Location                  | Where the project will be located. I usually put my projects under `C:\Dev\`.                                                    |
        | ðŸ”³ Create Git repository | Whether to initialize a git repository. You may have to install git for this to work.                                            |
        | Build system              | We will be using `Gradle` throughout this whole guide.                                                                           |
        | JDK                       | Make sure to choose/install a `JDK 21`, as that is the version required for developing plugins past version 1.20.5.              |
        | Gradle DSL                | We will be using `Kotlin`, so make sure to choose that.                                                                          |
        | ðŸ”³ Add sample code       | Whether to include some basic starter code files. You should disable this, as we will be building everything up from the ground. |
        | Gradle distribution       | You should choose `Wrapper` as that allows your project to be build from the command line even without having Gradle installed.  |
        | Gradle version            | It is good practise to keep this up-to-date. Make sure to choose **at least** `8.12`.                                            |
        | GroupId                   | This is essentially an unique identifier for your projects. It typically represents a domain in the reverse order. You may choose any group id, but it is good practise to choose one where you also own the domain. |
        | ArtifactId                | This setting doesn't affect anything with plugin development. You can just set it to your project name                           |

        The project files should look like this now:

        <FileTree>
        - BeginnerPlugin
            - .gradle/
            - .idea/
            - gradle/
            - src
                - main/
                - test/
            - build.gradle.kts
            - gradlew
            - gradlew.bat
            - settings.gradle.kts
        </FileTree>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Gradle CLI">
        When creating a new project with the Gradle CLI, you first want to create the directory, in which you want to create the project, and then run `gradle init`.

        ```bash
        $ mkdir BeginnerPlugin
        $ cd BeginnerPlugin
        $ gradle init
        ```

        It then will ask a few questions, in which you will want to choose `4`, `BeginnerPlugin`, `1`, and `no` respectively:

        ```bash
        Select type of build to generate:
          1: Application
          2: Library
          3: Gradle plugin
          4: Basic (build structure only)
        Enter selection (default: Application) [1..4] 4

        Project name (default: BeginnerPlugin): BeginnerPlugin

        Select build script DSL:
          1: Kotlin
          2: Groovy
        Enter selection (default: Kotlin) [1..2] 1

        Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no] no

        ```

        Now, you should have a very basic build structure, which should look something like this:

        <FileTree>
          - BeginnerPlugin
            - gradle/
            - .gitattributes
            - .gitignore
            - build.gradle.kts
            - gradle.properties
            - gradlew
            - gradlew.bat
            - settings.gradle.kts
        </FileTree>

        You can now safely open this project with IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDE/code editor of your choice.
