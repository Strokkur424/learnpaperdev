In order to start writing plugins, we first have to setup our project and our IDE. For this, [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
is the most widely used one. IntelliJ IDEA provides all tools and plugins necessary for efficient Java development and also provides native support for build tooling, like
[Gradle](https://gradle.org), which will be our choice of build tooling, as it is the suggested one by the PaperMC team.

## Installation

It is not necessary to install Gradle with IntelliJ together, as IntelliJ includes Gradle. But if you prefer to setup projects using a **CLI**, you may also
install Gradle with it.

        I personally recommend installing IntelliJ via the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), as it allows quick and easy
        updates of IntelliJ.

        Once you have installed the JetBrains Toolbox App, you will want to install **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**.

        After you have installed IntelliJ, you will want to open it and then open the settings by pressing `ctrl + alt + S`. You then want to navigate to `Plugins` and
        install the `Minecraft Development` plugin. It is a very widely used plugin for plugin and mod devs.

        <Tabs syncKey="os">
            <TabItem label="Windows">
                On Windows, you first want to download the latest Gradle distribution. It is enough for you to just download the [binaries](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=8.13&format=bin).
                Once you have done that, you will want to unpack the zip into a new folder: `C:\Program Files\Gradle`. The file tree should look like this:

                <FileTree>
                    - `C:\Program Files\Gradle`
                        - gradle-8.13
                            - bin/
                            - init.d/
                            - lib/
                            - LICENSE
                            - NOTICE
                            - README
                </FileTree>

                After this, you want to add a new `PATH` environment variable entry. For this you can just search for `environment variables` in the start menu and open the first entry.

                <details>
                    <summary>Environment variables in the start menu</summary>
                    <img src={EnvironmentVariables.src}/>
                </details>


                You will then want to add an entry into your `Path`, pointing to `C:\Program Files\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin`:

                <Steps>

                1. Click on `Environment Variables...` in the bottom right.

                2. In the user variables, select the `Path` variable.

                3. Click `Edit...`

                4. Click `New` to add a new entry

                5. Paste `C:\Program Files\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin` and click `OK`

                </Steps>

                </details>


                If you have done these steps correctly, you might have to close all open terminal processes for it to take effect.
                Now, you can run `gradle -v` in a new terminal session to verify your installed Gradle version.

                ```shell
                C:\>gradle -v

                ------------------------------------------------------------
                Gradle 8.13
                ------------------------------------------------------------
                ```

            </TabItem>

            <TabItem label="Linux">
                The recommended way to install Gradle on Linux is using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io), which also allows for managing multiple JDK installations:
                ```bash showlinenumbers=false
                $ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
                ```

                After you have installed SDKMAN!, you can now install Gradle.
                ```bash showlinenumbers=false
                $ sdk install gradle 1.13
                ```

## Creating a new project

<Tabs syncKey="setupWay">
    <TabItem label="IntelliJ">
        When creating a new project with IntelliJ, you will want to select `Java`. After that, you can fill out most fields however you want. Here is a quick breakdown of
        what each field does:

        | Field Name                | Usage                                                                                                                            |
        |---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | Name                      | This is the name of your project/plugin.                                                                                         |
        | Location                  | Where the project will be located. I usually put my projects under `C:\Dev\`.                                                    |
        | ðŸ”³ Create Git repository  | Whether to initialize a git repository. You may have to install git for this to work.                                            |
        | Build system              | We will be using `Gradle` throughout this whole guide.                                                                           |
        | JDK                       | Make sure to choose/install a `JDK 21`, as that is the version required for developing plugins past version 1.20.5.              |
        | Gradle DSL                | We will be using `Kotlin`, so make sure to choose that.                                                                          |
        | ðŸ”³ Add sample code        | Whether to include some basic starter code files. You should disable this, as we will be building everything up from the ground. |
        | Gradle distribution       | You should choose `Wrapper` as that allows your project to be build from the command line even without having Gradle installed.  |
        | Gradle version            | It is good practise to keep this up-to-date. Make sure to choose **at least** `8.12`.                                            |
        | GroupId                   | This is essentially an unique identifier for your projects. It typically represents a domain in the reverse order. You may choose any group id, but it is good practise to choose one where you also own the domain. |
        | ArtifactId                | This setting doesn't affect anything with plugin development. You can just set it to your project name                           |

            <img src={IntelliJNewProject.src}/>
        </details>

        <br/>
        The project files should look like this now:

        <FileTree>
        - BeginnerPlugin
            - .gradle/
            - .idea/
            - gradle/
            - src
                - main/
                - test/
            - build.gradle.kts
            - gradlew
            - gradlew.bat
            - settings.gradle.kts
        </FileTree>

        You can safely delete the `src` folder for now, as it contains stuff which we do not need yet.

        <Aside type="note">
        Whilst you can create projects using the Minecraft Development plugins, which include a few more settings and do more for you, I chose to instead create an
        empty project so that I can explain everything from the start without some (possibly overwhelming) preset.

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Gradle CLI">
        When creating a new project with the Gradle CLI, you first want to create the directory, in which you want to create the project, and then run `gradle init`.

        ```bash
        $ mkdir BeginnerPlugin
        $ cd BeginnerPlugin
        $ gradle init
        ```

        It then will ask a few questions, in which you will want to choose `4`, `BeginnerPlugin`, `1`, and `no` respectively:

        ```ansi showlinenumbers=false
        Select type of build to generate:
          1: Application
          2: Library
          3: Gradle plugin
          4: Basic (build structure only)
        Enter selection (default: Application) [1..4] 4

        Project name (default: BeginnerPlugin): BeginnerPlugin

        Select build script DSL:
          1: Kotlin
          2: Groovy
        Enter selection (default: Kotlin) [1..2] 1

        Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no] no

        Now, you should have a very basic build structure, which should look something like this:

        <FileTree>
          - BeginnerPlugin
            - gradle/
            - .gitattributes
            - .gitignore
            - build.gradle.kts
            - gradle.properties
            - gradlew
            - gradlew.bat
            - settings.gradle.kts
        </FileTree>

        You can now safely open this project with IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDE/code editor of your choice.
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Finishing the project setup

Currently, whether you created the project with IntelliJ or with Gradle, we are not done yet! There is still a few things missing. For once, our `build.gradle.kts` file doesn't contain anything
particularly useful. You should replace all of the content in it with the following:

```kts title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    id("java")
}

group = "com.learnpaperdev.beginner" // Replace with your own id
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT" // Our project version

repositories {
    // You can declare remote repositories here
}

dependencies {
    // You can declare dependencies here
}
```

### Setting up Gradle

You may be wondering: "What are dependencies and where do we get them from?" Basically, a dependency is just other Java code which you **compile against**. That means you can use their
code inside your own code. There are multiple types of dependencies, but the only relevant one for us for now is a compile-only dependency, which means that the other's code **is not
included in our own**. You will learn more about how this exactly works later, but for now, we will only be using `compileOnly(...)`.

Furtermore, there is two main ways on hwo you can depend on another's code. The first is using a **local file dependencies** â€” that means you just include their compiled or source
`jar-file` in your project. You can declare a jar-file dependency like this:

```kts title="build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
    compileOnly(files("path/to/dependency/file", "other/path", "..."))
}
```

The second possible dependency is a **remote dependency**. Those are declared like this:

```kts title="build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
    compileOnly("group.io:project-id:version")
}
```

The nototation inside the `compileOnly(...)` function is called `maven coordinates`. In simple terms, you could say that the `group.io` refers to "who", the `project-id` to "what",
and the `version` to the version.

If we want to compile against the **Paper API**, we have to declare our dependency like this:

```kts title="build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
    compileOnly("io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.21.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

As said before, `io.papermc.paper` refers to the group id of Paper, `paper-api` is the project id of the Paper API, and `1.21.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT` is the version of the server we will primarily
be compiling against (1.21.4). The `-R0.1-SNAPSHOT` part is something that has been part of the version for a really long time from way before Paper times. It has its reasons, but there
is not need to go into detail on that for now.

If you were to try to compile the project right now, it would still not include the Paper API, as Gradle doesn't know where to look â€” the internet is huge after all. For this we have the
`repositories` block. Here, we declare all paths where Gradle should look for dependencies.

Paper's repository is refered to with [https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/](https://repo.papermc.io/#browse/browse:maven-public). If we add this as an repository to our build file,
our Paper API dependency will be found. That would look like this:

```kts title="build.gradle.kts"
repositories {
    maven("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
}
```

#### The finished `build.gradle.kts`

Your build file should look like this now:

```kts title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    id("java")
}

group = "com.learnpaperdev.beginner" // Replace with your own id
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT" // Our project version

repositories {
    maven("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.21.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

### Setting up our source files

Currently, there are no Java-source files in our project. We add those inside the `src/main/java` directory. You should create that directory now.
The file structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  - BeginnerPlugin
    - src
        - main
            - java/
    - build.gradle.kts
    - ...
</FileTree>

What is the reason for this obscure structure? What do you need `main` for? And why an explicit `java` directory? Well, the reason for the `main` directory is that you can also have
stuff under `src/test`, which is typically the directory with all your unit test. This just helps separate files which should be compiled into the final output file from the test files.
And the reason for the explicit `java` directory is that you can also code plugins in other languages! There is a lot of other JVM-based languages, like `Groovy` or `Kotlin`. Those would
each have their own sub folder in the source folder. For example, for `Kotlin` you would choose `src/main/kotlin`.

Now, to create your first source file, we need even more directories. Inside the `java` directory, you should now create a few directories based on your `group-id`. In general,
you separate your group-id by its dots and make each of them a directory.

For example, for `com.learnpaperdev.beginner`, you would create the following directories:

<FileTree>
  - BeginnerPlugin
    - src
        - main
            - java
                - **com**
                    - **learnpaperdev**
                        - **beginner/**
    - build.gradle.kts
    - ...
</FileTree>

The reason for this tedious amount of folders is so that we can effectively separate the files of different plugins. Imagine that **Plugin A** has these files in their src:

<FileTree>
  - src
    - main
        - java
            - APlugin.java
                - PluginUtils.java
</FileTree>

And **Plugin B** has these files in their src:

<FileTree>
  - src
    - main
        - java
            - BPlugin.java
                - PluginUtils.java
</FileTree>

Now, both plugins declare a **PluginUtils.java** file. These may have different contents though. So how can the server, when loading both plugins, know which of these two `PluginUtil.java`
files one of the plugins references? The answer is: It just cannot. But if we separate them into different folders, each plugin will always be able to reference its specific one.

So yeah, now that you have craeted your folder structure, you can create your first source file: `BeginnerPlugin.java`. The empty source file should look like this:

```java
// Again, replace with your own group id â€” this should match the folder structure
package com.learningpaperdev.beginner;

public class BeginnerPlugin {
}
```
