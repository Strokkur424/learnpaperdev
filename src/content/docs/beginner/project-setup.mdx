In order to start writing plugins, we first have to setup our project and our IDE. For this, [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
is the most widely used one. IntelliJ IDEA provides all tools and plugins necessary for efficient Java development and also provides native support for build tooling, like
[Gradle](https://gradle.org), which will be our choice of build tooling, as it is the suggested one by the PaperMC team.

## Installation

It is not necessary to install Gradle with IntelliJ together, as IntelliJ includes Gradle. But if you prefer to setup projects using a **CLI**, you may also
install Gradle with it.

        I personally recommend installing IntelliJ via the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), as it allows quick and easy
        updates of IntelliJ.

        Once you have installed the JetBrains Toolbox App, you will want to install **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**.

            <TabItem label="Windows">
                On Windows, you first want to download the latest Gradle distribution. It is enough for you to just download the [binaries](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=8.13&format=bin).
                Once you have done that, you will want to unpack the zip into a new folder: `C:\Program Files\Gradle`. The file tree should look like this:

                <FileTree>
                    - `C:\Program Files\Gradle`
                        - gradle-8.13
                            - bin/
                            - init.d/
                            - lib/
                            - LICENSE
                            - NOTICE
                            - README
                </FileTree>

                After this, you want to add a new `PATH` environment variable entry. For this you can just search for `environment variables` in the start menu and open the first entry.

                <details>

                    <img src={EnvironmentVariables.src}/>
                </details>


                You will then want to add an entry into your `Path`, pointing to `C:\Program Files\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin`:

                <Steps>

                1. Click on `Environment Variables...` in the bottom right.

                2. In the user variables, select the `Path` variable.

                3. Click `Edit...`

                4. Click `New` to add a new entry

                5. Paste `C:\Program Files\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin` and click `OK`

                </Steps>

                </details>


                If you have done these steps correctly, you might have to close all open terminal processes for it to take effect.
                Now, you can run `gradle -v` in a new terminal session to verify your installed Gradle version.

                ```shell
                C:\>gradle -v

                ------------------------------------------------------------
                Gradle 8.13
                ------------------------------------------------------------
                ```

            <TabItem label="Linux">
                The recommended way to install Gradle on Linux is using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io), which also allows for managing multiple JDK installations:
                ```bash showlinenumbers=false
                $ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
                ```

                After you have install SDKMAN!, you can now install Gradle.
                ```bash showlinenumbers=false
                $ sdk install gradle 1.13
                ```
