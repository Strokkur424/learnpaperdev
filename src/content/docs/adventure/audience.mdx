import JavaDocs from "../components/JavaDocs.astro"

Almost every object, which can work with input, implements the <JavaDocs id="Audience"/> interface. That includes, but is not limited to:
- <JavaDocs id="Player"/>
- <JavaDocs id="CommandSender"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Entity"/> (and all its subclasses)
- <JavaDocs id="Server"/>
- <JavaDocs id="World"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Team"/>

There are a lot of methods declared in the <JavaDocs id="Audience"/> interface. Too many to list them all. It is recommended to just check out the JavaDocs on that.
The most important ones are these:

- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="sendMessage(net.kyori.adventure.text.ComponentLike)" name = "sendMessage(ComponentLike)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="sendActionBar(net.kyori.adventure.text.ComponentLike)" name = "sendActionBar(ComponentLike)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="sendPlayerListHeader(net.kyori.adventure.text.ComponentLike)" name = "sendPlayerListHeader(ComponentLike)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="sendPlayerListFooter(net.kyori.adventure.text.ComponentLike)" name = "sendPlayerListFooter(ComponentLike)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="playSound(net.kyori.adventure.sound.Sound)" name = "playSound(Sound)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="showTitle(net.kyori.adventure.title.Title)" name = "showTitle(Title)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="showBossBar(net.kyori.adventure.bossbar.BossBar)" name = "showBossBar(BossBar)"/>
- <JavaDocs id="Audience" method="openBook(net.kyori.adventure.inventory.Book)" name = "openBook(Book)"/>

## Server/World/Team
These objects have a special implementation of the <JavaDocs id="Audience"/> interface: The <JavaDocs id="ForwardingAudience"/>.
That means, instead of executing a a method for themselves, it executes it for all players backed by the individual object.

More specifically, sending a message to a...

...<JavaDocs id="Server"/> sends the message to every player and the console. <br/>
...<JavaDocs id="World"/> sends the message to every player in that world. <br/>
...<JavaDocs id="Team"/> sends the message to every player in that team.

This makes sending messages to multiple players very convenient.

## The <JavaDocs id="ForwardingAudience"/>
You can create your own forwarding audiences! For this, <JavaDocs id="Audience"/> provides a static method:
<JavaDocs id="Audience" method="audience(net.kyori.adventure.audience.Audience...)" name="Audience.audience(Audience...)"/>.
This allows for grouping multiple audiences together in order to have to only send a message (or similar) once and it reaching multiple targets.

This is particularly useful for stuff like a party system or certain mini games.
